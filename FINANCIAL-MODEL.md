# REZ Financial Model — Detailed Appendix

**Version:** 3.0 — Synced with upstream canonical deck (June 2026)
**Source of truth:** https://rez-deck.vercel.app/ (GitHub: imrejaul007/rez-deck)
**This file** extends the canonical deck with rigorous unit economics, P&L, and sensitivity analysis.

> **Note on numbers:** The canonical unit economics from the upstream deck are:
> - **AOV:** ₹650
> - **ARPU:** ₹195/month
> - **LTV:** ₹3,900
> - **CAC:** ₹76
> - **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 51.3x
>
> The detailed P&L below uses more conservative assumptions (per-merchant Year 1 is
> intentionally loss-leading while we acquire). Both views are reconciled in the
> Sensitivity Analysis section.

## 6. Key Assumptions

| Premium attach rate | 3% | 10% at scale |
| Retention | 85% YoY | Industry standard for SaaS |
| CAC | ₹6,150 | Optimizes to ₹4,500 by Y3 |

### Optimistic Case

| Assumption | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Merchant growth | 8x YoY | Viral/word-of-mouth |
| GMV growth | 25% YoY | Higher engagement |
| SaaS attach rate | 60% | Stronger sales push |
| Premium attach rate | 10% | More premium features |
| Retention | 90% YoY | Better product |

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

### Year 5 ARR (₹ Cr)

| Retention \ GMV Growth | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% |
|------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| **75%** | ₹32 | ₹38 | ₹44 | ₹52 |
| **85%** | ₹36 | ₹44 | ₹52 | ₹61 |
| **90%** | ₹40 | ₹50 | ₹60 | ₹70 |
| **95%** | ₹45 | ₹57 | ₹70 | ₹82 |

### Key Takeaway

> Even in pessimistic case (75% retention, 10% GMV growth), we hit ₹32 Cr ARR.
> In base case (85% retention, 15% GMV growth), we hit ₹50 Cr ARR.

## 8. Path to Profitability

### Timeline

| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Cash break-even | Month 18 | ₹20L/mo | Depends on burn control |
| EBITDA positive | Month 36 | ₹4 Cr/mo | Year 3 |
| Net profitable | Month 48 | ₹6 Cr/mo | Year 4 |

### Why EBITDA First?

1. **Sustainable growth** — don't burn cash to grow
2. **Investor confidence** — shows unit economics work
3. **Better fundraising** — profitable companies get better terms
4. **Acquisition optionality** — can be acquired anytime

## 9. Financial Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Slow merchant acquisition | Revenue miss 50% | Focus on product-led growth, referrals |
| Low SaaS attach rate | Revenue miss 30% | Invest in sales team, product demos |
| High churn | Revenue miss 40% | Coin system creates stickiness, invest in CS |
| Payment fraud | Brand damage | 2-layer verification, ML fraud detection |
| Competition | Margin pressure | Stay focused on T2-T3, don't compete on price |
