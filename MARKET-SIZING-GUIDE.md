## What VCs Actually Want to See

| Question | What They Mean |
|----------|---------------|
| "What's your TAM?" | "How big can this get if you win EVERYTHING?" |
| "What's your SAM?" | "How big is your actual reachable market?" |
| "What's your SOM?" | "How big is your realistic near-term market?" |
| "How did you calculate?" | "Are these real numbers or made up?" |

## The Famous Airbnb Market Sizing

When Airbnb pitched YC in 2009, they said:

```
TAM (Total Market): $600 Billion
├── Hotels: $450 Billion
├── Vacation Rentals: $100 Billion
└── Couchsurfing: $50 Billion

SAM (Serviceable): $30 Billion
├── Airbnb's addressable portion

SOM (Obtainable): $10 Million (Year 1)
├── Initial focus: NY, SF, LA
```

**Key insight:** They used TOP-DOWN for TAM (feels big) and BOTTOM-UP for SAM/SOM (shows execution).

---

## The Stripe Market Sizing (Example)

Stripe's pitch deck showed:

```
TAM: All Internet Commerce
├── Global e-commerce: $1.5 Trillion
└── Stripe's opportunity: $150 Billion

SAM: Online Payments (their actual target)
├── SMB + Enterprise online payments: $50 Billion
└── Stripe's obtainable: $2 Billion (Year 5)

SOM: Developers (near-term)
├── Global developers: 20 million
└── Stripe's target: 100,000 Year 1
```

## How to Calculate For ReZ

### STEP 1: Define Your Customer

```
Who pays you?
├── Merchant pays 2% transaction fee
├── Merchant pays ₹199/mo SaaS

Customer = SMB (restaurant, salon, retail) in India
```

### STEP 2: Top-Down (TAM)

```
Total Addressable Market (TAM)
├── India GDP: $3.5 Trillion
├── India Retail: $1.2 Trillion
└── India's SMB spending on software: $10 Billion (TAM)

This is your "if we win everything" number.
Don't over-inflate this. VCs will call it out.
```

### STEP 3: Bottom-Up (SAM) - THE REAL NUMBER

```
SAM = Total SMBs × Penetration × Revenue per SMB

Step 1: Count eligible SMBs
├── India restaurants: 7 million (NRAI data)
├── India salons: 2 million
├── India retail shops: 10 million
└── Total with physical presence: ~20 million

Step 2: Apply realistic penetration (Year 5)
├── Target cities (T2-T3): 100 cities
├── SMBs per city: ~50,000
├── Total target: 5 million SMBs
├── Realistic penetration: 10%
└── SAM: 500,000 merchants

Step 3: Revenue per merchant
├── Avg monthly GMV: ₹30,000
├── ReZ fee (2%): ₹600/month
├── SaaS (₹199): ₹2,388/year
└── Total annual: ₹9,588 per merchant

SAM = 500,000 × ₹9,588 = ₹480 Crore (Year 5)
```

### STEP 4: SOM (Near-Term - Year 1)

```
Serviceable Obtainable Market

City: Lucknow (pop: 3 million)
├── Restaurants: ~10,000
├── Salons: ~5,000
├── Small retail: ~15,000
└── Total: 30,000 SMBs

Year 1 targets:
├── Target: 2,000 merchants
├── Avg GMV: ₹25,000/month
├── Revenue: 2,000 × ₹25,000 × 12 × 2% = ₹1.2 Crore
└── SaaS: 1,000 × ₹199 × 12 = ₹24 Lakh

SOM Year 1: ₹1.44 Crore
```

## The Correct Numbers for ReZ

| Market | Inflated (My #) | Correct (Bottom-Up) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **TAM** | ₹12,000 Cr | ₹10,000 Cr (all India SMB software) |
| **SAM** | ₹12,000 Cr | ₹500 Cr (Year 5, realistic) |
| **SOM** | ₹300 Cr | ₹1.5 Cr (Year 1, Lucknow) |

| TAM | All India SMBs | ₹10,000 Cr | All time |
| SAM | T2-T3 SMBs | ₹500 Cr | Year 5 |
| SOM | Lucknow first | ₹1.5 Cr | Year 1 |

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ DON'T: Inflated Numbers
```
TAM: ₹1 Lakh Crore (made up)
├── This is ridiculous
└── VCs will laugh you out

SAM: ₹50,000 Crore (not defensible)
├── Why would you claim 50% of TAM?
└── Shows you don't understand your market
```

### ❌ DON'T: No Methodology
```
TAM: ₹12,000 Cr (because we said so)
├── No calculation
├── No sources
└── Red flag for due diligence
```

### ❌ DON'T: Confusing SAM/TAM
```
TAM: Restaurants
SAM: Lucknow restaurants
SOM: My restaurant

This is backwards.
```

---

## What TO Do

### ✅ DO: Show Your Math

```
Market Sizing Methodology:

1. Starting Point:
   - India has 7 million restaurants (NRAI 2024)

2. Our Target:
   - Focus: T2-T3 cities
   - 100 cities × 50,000 SMBs = 5 million

3. Realistic Penetration:
   - Year 5: 10% = 500,000 merchants

4. Revenue per Merchant:
   - Monthly GMV: ₹30,000
   - ReZ fee: 2% = ₹600
   - SaaS: ₹199/mo = ₹2,388/yr
   - Total: ₹9,588/year

5. SAM = 500,000 × ₹9,588 = ₹480 Crore
```

### ✅ DO: Cite Sources

```
- "According to NRAI, India has 7M restaurants"
- "Zomato annual report: ₹50,000 Cr GMV processed"
- "RBI: UPI processed ₹18 Lakh Cr in FY2024"
- "NASSCOM: India has 63M SMBs"
```

### ✅ DO: Show Conservative Assumptions

```
"Even if we only capture 0.1% of TAM..."
"Conservative estimate based on..."
"We're being conservative here..."
```

## Pro Tip: The 5-Second Rule

When an investor looks at your market slide, they should be able to answer in 5 seconds:

1. Is the market big enough? (TAM)
2. Can they reach it? (SAM)
3. Can they win it soon? (SOM)

If they can't, your slide is too complex.

Shall I update the pitch deck with these corrected numbers?
